# TODO
- fix custom scripts
- see which files are needed, the trigger event one might
- make the plugins file pretty
- could even fuse it with lazy
- animations dont seem to be working (might nuke)
- the catpuccin conf might be useless
- so might be the Treesitter file

- heirline doesnt work
- there is no scroll bar
- user Defer in lazy might be the cause
- remove useless packages
- change the lazy events so that they are spaced out over the file
- add an autocmd to close the tree when leaving oil
